## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add options `USE_GIT` and `USE_SVN` with default value `AUTO` to enforce
  install corresponding checker, even if no program has found.

- Detect JS project dir and extract package name and version from `package.json`.

  segment based on files (patterns) present in the current directory.
